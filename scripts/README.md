# Utility scripts 

1. arrange $(pwd)
    - which arranges different file types into respective folder i wrote this script just to arrange my downloads folder 

2. kty -> Launch kitty terminal

3. launch -> simple script that will launch some apps (chrome, nautilus,and gnome terminal)

4. pre my short python runtime for quick dry runs

```sh
sh ./install.sh
```

if you add ~/scripts to your `PATH` Then you don't need to do install.sh as you use them directly from scripts folder

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/scripts:$PATH"
``` 
This is folder in ~/scripts/* if you add this to zshrc you can use the following commands

1. arrange $(pwd)
2. kty
3. launch
4. pre
